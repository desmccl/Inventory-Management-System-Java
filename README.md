# Inventory-Management-System-Java

### This is an inventory management system created for a project for my Software 1 class that demonstrates an understanding of the Java language.

This inventory system is written entirely in Java using Scenebuilder to create the GUI. The IDE used is IntellijIdea.

It allows a user to manage an inventory of parts that are created inhouse or outsourced from a company. 
It also allows management of products that can be comprised of parts both inhouse and outsourced. 

The functionalities that it supports are as follows:
- Adding a part (inhouse or outsourced)
- Adding a product
- Searching for parts by id or name
- Searching for products by id or name
- Associating parts to a product
- Modification of inhouse/outsourced parts as well as products

The ID's are autogenerated for the parts and products and can not be edited by the user.
